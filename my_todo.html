		<h2>Personal Adventure TODO List</h2>
		<h4>"Life is either a great adventure or nothing." - Helen Keller</h4>
	</div>

	<div class="article_options">
		<p>I don't want to turn 80 and look back on life wondering "why didn't I try that?" So, I am keeping a list of personal adventures I would like to do.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Hike (part of) the Appalachian Trail
				<p>The Appalachian Trail is the longest hiking-only footpath in the world, ranging from Maine to Georgia. Every year hundreds of people set out on the 3-Month trek spanning the East coast of the United States. I do not have that much time to dedicate, all at once. But, I would like to spend a few days/weeks per year hiking portions of the trail.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Learn to Fly a Helicopter
				<p>Flying in an airplane is actually one of my <em>least</em> favorite things to do... ever. But, I am really interested in taking an aerial tour of NYC and other cities. The best way to do this is by Helicopter. Plus, if I learn to fly a chopper I will be a crucial asset during the Zombie apocalypse.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Live in a European Country
				<p>This one kind of explains itself. I have spent a lot of time visiting Europe, but I've always felt like a tourist. I would love to spend at least three years living and working in Europe.</p>
			</li>
